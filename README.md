A lil repo to test timed deploy hooks

## A webhook is created in Netlify

This can be called by any service, via a url, to trigger a new deploy.

## IFTTT

Set up a trigger in IFTTT at quarter past the hour to call the web hook, and therefore a redeploy

## Site created

[A JSON feed is created](https://jokes-are-all-about-timing.netlify.app/feed.json). This can be used in ads, if needed

Here's [a handy page](https://jokes-are-all-about-timing.netlify.app/), to see the content as it might be displayed
